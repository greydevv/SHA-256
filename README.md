# SHA-256

A C implementation of the widely used cryptographic 256-bit Secure Hashing Algorithm. This is my basic implementation of the algorithm and therefore should not be used in environments where security is important. Protection against popular SHA-256 cracks have not been implemented; this was created simply to help myself learn about how hashing algorithms work.
